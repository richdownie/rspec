Feature: code-breaker submits guess

  The code-breaker submits a guess of four colored
  pegs. The game marks the guess with black and
  white "marker" pegs.

  For each peg in the guess that matches the color
  and position of a peg in the secret code, the
  mark includes one black peg. For each additional
  peg in the guess that matches the color but not
  the position of a peg in the secret code, a
  white peg is added to the mark.
